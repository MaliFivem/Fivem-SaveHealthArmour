This is a simple C# STANDALONE resource that save every 15 seconds player's health and armour!
That use LiteDB to save into Database.
If you want to change something you have to open the files in the src folder and recompile everything, 
otherwise put the SaveHealthArmour folder in resources and add in your server.cfg
 # ...

  start SaveHealthArmour
